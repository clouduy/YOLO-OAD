### PR Best Practices

To ensure smooth integration of your contributions:

- ‚úÖ **Keep PRs Synchronized** ‚Äì Ensure your PR is up-to-date with the `clouduy/YOLO-OAD` `master` branch. Use the 'Update branch' button or run `git pull` and `git merge master` locally.

<p align="center"><img width="751" alt="Screenshot 2022-08-29 at 22 47 15" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/187295893-50ed9f44-b2c9-4138-a614-de69bd1753d7.png"></p>

- ‚úÖ **Verify CI Checks** ‚Äì Ensure all Continuous Integration tests pass before final submission.

- ‚úÖ **Focus on Essentials** ‚Äì Concentrate on the minimal changes needed for your improvement. As Bruce Lee said: *"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."*

## Areas of Particular Interest

We especially welcome contributions in these areas aligned with YOLO-OAD's research focus:

- **DLADH Optimizations**: Improvements to the Deformable Lightweight Asymmetric Decoupled Head
- **C3LKSCAA Enhancements**: Better long-range context dependency and receptive field handling
- **C3VGGAM Refinements**: Enhanced local feature extraction and semantic information preservation
- **Focal-EIoU Loss**: Advanced bounding box regression techniques
- **Autonomous Driving Applications**: Real-world performance improvements for traffic objects

## Submitting a Bug Report üêõ

If you encounter issues with YOLO-OAD, please submit a detailed Bug Report!

To help us investigate effectively, we need to reproduce the issue. Follow these guidelines:

When reporting problems, include **code** that others can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the issue. Create a [minimum reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/) with these characteristics:

- ‚úÖ **Minimal** ‚Äì Use the least code needed to reproduce the problem
- ‚úÖ **Complete** ‚Äì Include all necessary components for reproduction
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible** ‚Äì Test your code to ensure it reliably demonstrates the issue

Additionally, for effective support:

- ‚úÖ **Current Version** ‚Äì Ensure you're using the latest code from [master](https://github.com/clouduy/YOLO-OAD/tree/master)
- ‚úÖ **Standard Configuration** ‚Äì Issues should be reproducible with the original YOLO-OAD implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è

If your issue meets these criteria, please submit a new issue using the üêõ **Bug Report** template and provide a [minimum reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/).
